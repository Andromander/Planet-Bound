# Planet Bound
A mod for Minecraft created by the Cryptic Mushroom

## Setting up the workspace
Please run the `setup_decomp_workspace.bat` batch file in the `setup` folder to make your workspace work. If you experience any issues in code that only you are dealing with, please delete your local repository and re-clone.

## Building the mod
There should be a batch script in the `setup` folder called `build.bat` which should make your life a million times easier. I recommend using MultiMC for testing your built jar mods.
